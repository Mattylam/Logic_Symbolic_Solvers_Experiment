# solution in Python:
def solution():
    # Anne is quiet.
    quiet(Anne)
    # Erin is furry.
    furry(Erin)
    # Erin is green. 
    green(Erin)
    # Fiona is furry.
    furry(Fiona)
    # Fiona is quiet.
    quiet(Fiona)
    # Fiona is red.
    red(Fiona)
    # Fiona is rough.
    rough(Fiona) 
    # Fiona is white.
    white(Fiona) 
    # Harry is furry. 
    furry(Harry)
    # Harry is quiet.
    quiet(Harry)
    # Harry is white.
    white(Harry) 
    # Young people are furry.
    ForAll([x], Implies(young(x), furry(x)))
    # If Anne is quiet then Anne is red. 
    Implies(quiet(Anne), red(Anne))
    # Young, green people are rough.
    ForAll([x], Implies(And(young(x), green(x)),rough(x)))
    # If someone is green then they are white.
    ForAll([x], Implies(green(x), white(x)))
    #If someone is furry and quiet then they are white. 
    ForAll([x], Implies(And(furry(x), quiet(x)),white(x)))
    # If someone is young and white then they are rough. 
    ForAll([x], Implies(And(young(x), white(x)),rough(x)))
    # All red people are young.
    ForAll([x], Implies(red(x), young(x)))

    # Question: the following statement true, false, or unknown? Anne is white.
