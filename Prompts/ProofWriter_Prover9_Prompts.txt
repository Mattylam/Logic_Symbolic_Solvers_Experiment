Given a problem description and a question. The task is to parse the problem and the question into first-order logic formulars.
The grammar of the first-order logic formular is defined as follows:
1) logical conjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∧ expr2
2) logical disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∨ expr2
3) logical exclusive disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ⊕ expr2
4) logical negation of expr1: ¬expr1
5) expr1 implies expr2: expr1 → expr2
6) expr1 if and only if expr2: expr1 ↔ expr2
7) logical universal quantification: ∀x
8) logical existential quantification: ∃x
